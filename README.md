This is the keynote and powerpoint slides from the "React / Redux - a comprehensive introduction" presentation held at Making Waves friday 10.02.2017.

The presentations contains a lot of overlapping elements that appears at key click.
Therefore you must "play" the presentation to get any meaning out of it.

If you have both keynote and powerpoint, I recommend using keynote as it gives the best transitions between overlapping elements and pages.

I hope you will learn something by this presentation.

Kind Regards
